<p>I am a first year PhD student at the Interactive Intelligence Group at TU Delft working with <a href="https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/">Dr. Frans Oliehoek</a>. Previously, I received my MSc in Computer Science from University of Oxford with distinction (2019) and my BSc in Artificial Intelligence from University of Liverpool with first class degree (2018). I have also spent time doing a research intern at <a href="https://www.latentlogic.com">Latent Logic</a> (now part of Waymo).</p>
