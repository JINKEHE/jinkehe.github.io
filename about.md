I am currently reading MSc in Computer Science at University of Oxford. In 2018, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with first class honours from University of Liverpool. I have also spent time doing a research intern at [Latent Logic](https://www.latentlogic.com). I will start my PhD career in Machine Learning from September 2019 with [Frans Oliehoek](https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/) at TU Delft.

I am interested in Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
