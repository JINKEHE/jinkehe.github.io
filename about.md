I am a master student studying Computer Science at University of Oxford. In 2018 Summer, I had a research intern at [Latent Logic](https://www.latentlogic.com). Before I came to Oxford, I was an undergraduate student at Department of Computer Science, University of Liverpool. I am interested in Reinforcement Learning.
