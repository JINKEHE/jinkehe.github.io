I am reading MSc in Computer Science at University of Oxford. In 2018, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with first class honours from University of Liverpool. I have also spent time doing a research intern at [Latent Logic](https://www.latentlogic.com). I am interested in Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
