I am a third year PhD student at the Department of Intelligent Systems at TU Delft working with [Dr. Frans Oliehoek](https://www.fransoliehoek.net/wp/) and [Prof. Catholijn Jonker]. Previously, I received my MSc in Computer Science from University of Oxford with distinction (2019) and my BSc in Artificial Intelligence from University of Liverpool with first class degree (2018). I have also spent time doing a research intern at [Latent Logic](https://www.latentlogic.com) (now part of Waymo).
