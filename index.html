    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>I am a third year PhD student at the Department of Intelligent Systems at Delft University of Technology under the
        supervision
        of Dr. Frans A. Oliehoek. Prior to this, I completed my master at University of Oxford and my bachelor at
        University of Liverpool. The research topics that I am interested in include Reinforcement Learning and
        Planning.
