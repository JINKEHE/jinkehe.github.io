    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p> I am a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Frans A. Oliehoek at the Department of Intelligent Systems, Delft University of Technology. Prior to this, I received my Master of Science (with distinction) from University of Oxford and my Bachelor of Science (with first class honours) from University of Liverpool. I am generally interested in scalable sequential decision making and in particular, making online planning fast with abstractions.
